\section{Related work}

The immense number of complexities and historical artifacts that played a role in the beginnings, successes and failures of the Arab Spring prohibit a full exploration here.  Instead, we provide only a summary of some of the more widely accepted factors, and ones that readers should be aware of and keep in mind throughout our analysis. For a more detailed overview, we direct the reader to \citeapos{gelvin_arab_2015} recent book. In this section, we also discuss recent work utilizing social and/or news media during the Arab Spring, detailing how the methods and data used here are both similar and different.  

\subsection{Causal factors of the Arab Spring}

Two broad classes of causal factors can be considered - those that prompted revolution, and those which affected the success or failure of revolutions.  We briefly review each set of factors here.

\subsubsection{Causes of protests and their spread}

A host of historical factors led to the conditions in 2011 that made many nations in the Arab world ripe for protest \cite{gelvin_arab_2015}. One long-standing issue was the increasing extent of economic problems caused by ineffective, corrupt and state-run economies.  These issues led to high levels of unemployment and inflation \cite{dewey_impact_2012} as well as to both food shortages and huge hikes in food prices, all of which contributed to high levels of civil unrest \cite{goldstone_cross-class_2011,comunello_will_2012}.  The effect of high unemployment rates was particularly a problem because its effect was particularly strong on well-educated youth populations, individuals who had often been promised that their education efforts would be rewarded with jobs \cite{dewey_impact_2012,gelvin_arab_2015}. This, combined with a ``youth buldge'' in which a disproportionate percentage of the population was  between the ages of 15-29 in many of the MENA region countries, provided a fodder of civil unrest that required only a spark to ignite and a gust of wind to spread throughout the region.

This spark came, as noted above, in the form of Mohamed Bouazizi.  While Bouazizi may have provided the spark, it is generally aggreed upon that social media, or more aptly, the existence of communication infrastructures that supported all forms of new media\citep{wolfsfeld_social_2013,tufekci_social_2012}, served as the wind to spread the flame to Egypt, to Libya and on to several other nations in the Arab world.  Even before the protests, however, the existence of internet connectivity allowed individuals within the Arab region to observe the democratic processes existent in other regions of the world, stoking their desire to live in that type of environment \cite{hussain_what_2013}. During the early moments of the revolutions, these tools allowed both deliberate diffusion processes, defined as those ``carried out via the conscious sharing of tactics and frames by activists who are linked by networks that may be transnational'' and demonstration diffusion effects,  `` ' the power of precedent' '' to occur, rapidly engulfing an increasing number of actors in an increasing number of nations in protest \citep{}.  Through both logics, a further cause of spread was the strengthening of an underlying Arabic identity, which united protesters in their unified goal of empowerment and the ending of corruption. 
	
\subsubsection{Causes of Varying Outcomes}

\citeauthor{goldstone_bringing_2013} \citeyearpar{goldstone_bringing_2013} suggests that several additional predictors were important in determining whether or not a particular government was ultimately overthrown.  Chief amongst these predictors, he argued, was the structure of the overarching regime had a strong impact on whether or not the government was ultimately overthrown.  This view is a piece of a consistent take on  the properties of the ruling regime as the primary factor in the success of a particular revolution\cite{bellin_reconsidering_2012,comunello_will_2012,goldstone_bringing_2013}.  Goldstone defines a \emph{personalist} regime as one in which a single individual – who may have begun as an elected leader, or head of a military or even party regime – takes total or nearly total control of the national government. He then provides qualitative evidence for his believe that ``the single best key to where regimes in MENA have been overturned or faced massive rebellions is where personalist regimes have arisen''.

\citeapos{goldstone_bringing_2013} work argues that personalist regimes were the most susceptible because their power was tied to their ability to provide the necessary economic and political incentives to their constituency, particularly in nations that depended on oil production.  While \cite{comunello_will_2012} notes that personalist, or as he refers to them, neopatrimonial states, had controlling arms that made it difficult to organize any sort of formal protest, three other factors led to conditions in which such formal protests could arise.

One such factor that has already been discussed was the economic conditions under which the revolution occurred. While these economics played a role in bringing about revolution, they also prevented personalist regimes from being about to ``buy their way out'' of the protests, and thus also had a role in the revolutions' successes. The second factor that played into the success of personalist regimes in the face of revolution was the relationship of the regime to the military \cite{comunello_will_2012,battera_perspectives_2014}.  This relationship can be boiled down to one decision the military made - whether or not to shoot at the protestors \cite{bellin_reconsidering_2012}\footnote{While regimes certainly had other forces willing to deal with the protestors, the extent and breadth of the protests eventually came to a point at which it ``is sufficient to look at the character of the military and its capacity and will to repress in order to reckon the immediate chances of regime survival.'' \cite{bellin_reconsidering_2012}(pg. xx).}.  In countries where the military made the decision to quell protests with violent force, protesters were able to flood the streets without fear of the full wrath of the state. This lack of impunity led to stronger protests that eventually led to the downfall of the Tunisian and Egyptian regimes.  In contrast, in Saudi Arabia, for example, where the military opted to side with the regime and use force to quell protests, regimes managed to maintain power.

In making the decision of whether or not to fire on protestors, one important factor was  the extent to which previously disparate social groups formed a cross-class coalition  in their protests and revolutionary efforts \cite{goldstone_cross-class_2011}.  A unified coalition of protestors made it more difficult for the military to justify the use of force in their response to the protest for two reasons. First, the combination of various social groups lessened the military's ability to claim that violent actions were a response to a particular out-group in the interest of protecting the ``nation''.  Second, the sheer size of such a coalition would relegate military action to being viewed as ``illigitimate slaughter'' \cite{bellin_reconsidering_2012}.  

The development of these unified coalitions across various social groups also provided an opportunity for the news media to characterize protestors under a national identity, rather than as protests via one specific subgroup.  As we discuss shortly, the portrayals of the revolutions by news media thus had an important impact on revolutionary outcomes in that their coverage ultimately influenced a final factor in revolutionary success, which was the extent and type of involvment in the revolutions in the various nations from international powers \cite{goldstone_bringing_2013,comunello_will_2012}.  This applies both to the actions of the West during the revolutions as well as the actions taken by Arab nations themselves.  

Social media, of course, had much the same effect, increasing both the level of information spread and the extent to which individuals felt compelled to participate in protests \cite{tufekci_social_2012,wolfsfeld_social_2013,bellin_reconsidering_2012}. As insinuated above, it is generally agreed upon that social media, and new media more generally, played at least some role in the spread and success of certain revolutions that occurred during the Arab Spring.  There do exist, however, many scholars who feel this effect has been overstated, or that no such effect exists at all. \cite{comunello_will_2012} give an overview of a significant amount of work focusing on the relationship between social media and the Arab Spring.  The authors consider how, across 8 different properties of socail media, technological determinists (people who believed social media played \emph{the} causal factor) and the techno-realists (people who believed social media played \emph{no} causal role) differ on their opinions regarding the effect of social media.  Additionally, \cite{hussain_what_2013} provide a unique analysis of the role that communication infrastructures played in coordination with other effects on the revolutions.

\subsection{Using new media to study the Arab Spring}

Having given our stance on the question of whether or not social media played a role in the revolution, we now turn to how data from social media has been used to better understand the processes inherent to the revolution as a whole.  In particular, we focus on Twitter, as this is the data available to us in the present study.  The earliest work we are aware of to look at the relationship between new media and the Arab Spring was that of \cite{lotan_revolutions_2011}. The authors stress the strong interplay between Twitter and news media, and showed that the relationships between mainstream media outlets, activists, journalists and bloggers differed in datasets collected from Tunisia and Egypt. \cite{lotan_revolutions_2011} considered data that used the hashtags \#egypt or \#libya, finding that Egypt and Libya displayed differing amounts of tweets in the two major languages of interest, Arabic and English.  Egypt having significantly more tweets in Arabic than English, and Libya the other way around. Later work by \cite{bruns_arab_2013} observed that the English-speaking world lost interest in the events relevant to the Arab Spring much earlier than those tweeting in Arabic.   As we focus largely on English-language keywords, such language effects must be kept in mind.

Perhaps most relevant to the present work, however, are the efforts of\cite{borge-holthoefer_content_2014}. These authors use Twitter data to test the extent to which individuals switched between Secularist and Islamist and pro and anti-military ``camps'' in Egypt during the Arab Spring.  While the authors focus on Arabic tweets, their efforts show that Twitter data provides a unique lens through which important and interesting social processes relevant to the revolutions can be studied. We extend their efforts to new questions, new data and new methods in the present work.
%\cite{bruns_arab_2013} work considers usage patterns in tweets that had the hashtags \#egypt or \#libya over the course of ten months in 2011.  

%One of the earliest works to focus on the use of Twitter during the Arab Spring was that of \cite{lotan_revolutions_2011}. This observation 

%Information structures differed across countries 


%\cite{lotan_revolutions_2011}
%For example, journalists and activists in both cases appeared to serve as primary information sources, with their efforts being retweeted by a variety of other types of actors.    
%These interested parties fall into roughly three categories:%1. People directly connected to an incident, either as residents or expatriates that want to%know about dangerous conditions and the state of their homes and families, or who are%experiencing a crisis event firsthand;%2. MSM who want to learn about developments on the ground so that they can provide upto-%date coverage across media channels and hold audience attention; and%3. General interest readers who want to know about events as they happen.

%\cite{bruns_arab_2013}   They found, consistent with a variety of previous work, that Arabic and English speaking users mostly interacted amongst themselves, and thus that there existed only a few actors who bridged the two communities.    This suggests that international interests varied and that within these nations there was varying levels of use of Twitter.  Finally,

\subsection{The role of the news media}

As argued by \cite{hussain_what_2013}, international news media organizations were important in the Arab Spring in that they brought world-wide attention to the events in the region, helping to ``stave off overtly violent reactions from security forces''.  We would thus expect that the degree of coverage for particular topics, especially those relating to violence and revolution, should have interesting relationships with the success and/or failure of uprisings across the Arab world.  \cite{goldstone_cross-class_2011} argues in a similar fashion that the extent to which the news media portrayed ``protestors as representative of the whole society, rather than as one particular group seeking partisan advantages for itself'' was likely to impact the success of the revolution.  We thus consider the extent to which this is the case in our data.

Other work by \cite{joseph_arab_2014} has considered quantitative approaches to using news media data to better understand the Arab Spring.  Specifically, the authors use news media to instantiate a dynamic network agent-based model and use model output to predict successful revolutions.  While their use of newspaper data chiefly incorporates off-the-shelf statistical tools, it is an important indicator that news media data can be used 	in large quantities to provide accurate models of underlying social processes.
