Lots of event-data studies. Also, complaints that models can't predict (\url{http://parusanalytics.com/eventdata/papers.dir/MPSA11.ICEWS.sequence2.1.pdf}).  We should develop a model that is both suggestive and predictive.

If a protest draws support mainly from just one class or group (peasants, workers,students, urban shopkeepers, professionals), the state can confront that group as a disruptiveforce, and seek to unify elites from other sectors against that threat. However, ifprotestors represent many different groups, it is much harder for the state to find alliesagainst them. Moreover, while a state can claim to be preserving society by actingagainst isolated disruptive elements, it is far more difficult to maintain legitimacy whenacting against a broad cross-class coalition. Elites are more likely to desert the state, creatingcrippling elite divisions, if protestors represent a broad spectrum of society. Inaddition, a broad cross-class coalition facilitates further mobilization by creating ‘meganetworks’linking prior, tightly-linked within-group networks to each other. The impactof public media in favor of the protestors is also greater if media representation showsprotestors as representative of the whole society, rather than as one particular groupseeking partisan advantages for itself.

three successful revolutions in the Arab world in 2011, in Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya,all demonstrate the crucial role of cross-class coalitions.

In short, what was just recently a remarkably tough coalitioncapable of unseating a regime, even of conducting a civil war to do so, can become a packof feuding forces in the aftermath of successful revolt.There are three ways that this fracturing of coalitions can play out – constructive opposition,paralysis, or polarization.

It is too early to tell which outcome is most likely in the Arab revolts. It is still possiblethat a future event

When they began, there was hope that the Arab Revolutions of 2011 would be like the peaceful “velvet” or “color” revolutions in the USSR and Eastern Europe in 1989, or in the Ukraine in 2004.  Instead, with the possible exception of Tunisia, they have turned out to be more like true, classic revolutions with civil wars, counter-revolutions, high levels of violence, and extended periods of turmoil and sudden shifts in government.  There are a number of reasons for this difference, including (1) the greater youth of populations in the Arab revolutions; (2) the role of ideological contenders for power – Islamists – alongside the secular liberal revolutionaries; (3) the major interventions of outside powers; and (4) greater internal regional, ethnic and tribal divisions.

what resulted from this common foundation of unemployment, inequality, corruption, media links and protest differed enormously from country to country. In Tunisia, Egypt, and Yemen seemingly invulnerable autocrats who had ruled for decades surrendered power, stepping down or fleeing in the face of mounting nation-wide popular protests. In Libya and Syria similarly autocratic leaders instead mobilized for war and undertook an all-out military assault on their opponents; Libya’s failed but Syria’s regime has so far succeeded in holding on to power. In contrast, in Algeria, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain protests fizzled or were quickly snuffled out. And in Morocco, Oman, Kuwait and Jordan monarchs turned to varying degrees of constitutional reform and working with elected parliaments; in these cases reforms appear to have brought peace by deflecting demands for revolt or revolution.

Three factors of regimes that indicate how they faired:
-personalist regimes (where a single individual – who may have begun as an elected leader, or head of a military or even party regime – takes control of the national government) are particularly vulnerable to revolutionary collapse in the event of widespread popular uprising
    -monarchies () were much more stable
    -Personalist regimes include the regimes of Saleh in Yemen, Ghaddafi in Libya, Assad in Syria, Ben Ali in Tunisia, and Mubarak in Egypt
    -Libya is the major outlier among the personalist regimes, with vast oil revenues forming the base of the economy and providing the regime with substantial resources.
    
-a number of regimes in the region rule major oil and gas producing states. As Michael Ross (2012) has argued, states that control revenues that are easily and secretly controlled, that do not require taxation, and that are large enough to give the state the ability to maintain a large cadre of elite supporters, institutions, and popular largesse have exceptional resilience against popular demands.
    -The oil-poor states (Morocco and Jordan) went the furthest in their reforms; the oil-rich states (Oman, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia) did the least
    
-a state’s position in the international states-system has major consequences for the possibilities of change.
    - Bahrain faced perhaps the most massive protests ever seen in an authoritarian regime, in proportion to its population. However, it received help from Saudi Arabia.

In sum, the single best key to where regimes in MENA have been overturned or faced massive rebellions is where personalist regimes have arisen. In contrast to the monarchies, which all have either survived with reforms or even become counter-revolutionary, the personalist regimes have all crumbled – with the exception of Syria, which is slowly succumbing to civil war and survives in large part because of a favorable balance of external intervention.Among these regimes, the relative ease with which they were overthrown depended on the availability of oil revenues and the impact of international actions.


It has seemed odd to many that the Arab states not yet mentioned – Lebanon, the Palestinian Authority, Iraq, and Algeria – were hardly touched by the wave of protests that erupted in the Arab Spring.

This too can be explained by a focus on the state, rather than on the structural or populist reasons for protest. The countries where the Arab Spring had its impact were monarchies and personalist regimes

Egypt and Tunisia changed their regimes with relatively little violence. Yet their change has not gone as smoothly as hoped.

Yemen has had a relatively peaceful change of regime, but it has not had peace

The vast majority of revolutionary transitions took 5 years or more, with a median of 8 years
