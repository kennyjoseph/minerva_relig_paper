Why newspaper is bad data for this: 
    Difficult to extract organizers, who is actually involved if you arent native and involved in the scene

Questions he asked to get at instability
		when was the first time you saw a cop?
		were you working w/ the military

		internal factionalization within the government
		rising unemployment, strikes, inflation, tourist industry, petty crime, violent attacks, ideologists stuff, 



Things that twitter was used for:
    Symbolic language (majority)
	meet here ... (minority)
    documenting repression... (minority)

Important to note that people in Egypt knew something was going to happen weeks before the 25th ... something in Cairo is gonna happen 

Difference between really biased newspapers ... who said nothing was really happening ... and the international news who could cover it reasonably

Reasons why egyptians decided to revolt:
    well if they can do it (Tunesia) ... most Egyptians consider Egypt a pivot point of the Middle East 
    opression in general

what did the intercountry interactions look like?

Egyptians relied heavily on rumors ... when you havea  start where everyone knows the news is propaganda .. you rely on rumors more  

    Also when the media is obviously lying ... I'm looking at this streety as its being recorded ... the typical egyptian deligimizes the news

	they also get a lot of international news from satellite TV ... 


People responded to instability by creating their own states, (re)defining thugs and prosecuting them
    thugs are people w/ darker skin from specific neighborhoods ... state used thug for people who 

the state runs through the threat of instability -> 	
    
		the downtown area before aug 2013 ... every week protests ...  we need people to pick up *trash*

		Luxor -> Islamist attack in the 90s

		Political islamists are the other  (since the 20s)

		state insecurity -> terrorist attacks (Anti islamist/extrimists)	

a lot of Egyptian scholars have dismissed Islamist symbolism  ... the people want a secular gov't
