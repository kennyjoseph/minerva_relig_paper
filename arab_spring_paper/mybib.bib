	abstract = {The internet and the mobile phone have disrupted many of our conventional understandings of our selves and our relationships, raising anxieties and hopes about their effects on our lives. This timely and vibrant book provides frameworks for thinking critically about the roles of digital media in personal relationships. Rather than providing exuberant accounts or cautionary tales, it offers a data-grounded primer on how to make sense of these important changes in relational life. The book identifies the core relational issues these media disturb and shows how the ways we talk about them echo historical discussions about earlier communication technologies. Chapters explore how we use mediated language and nonverbal behavior to develop and maintain communities, social networks, new relationships, and to maintain relationships in our everyday lives. It combines research findings with lively examples to address questions such as whether mediated interaction can be warm and personal, whether people are honest about themselves online, whether relationships that start online can work, and whether using these media damages the other relationships in our lives. Throughout, the book argues for approaching these questions with firm understandings of the qualities ofmedia as well as the social and personal contexts in which they are developed and used. Personal Connections in the Digital Age will be required reading for all students and scholars of media, communication studies, and sociology, as well as all those who want a firmer understanding of digital media and everyday life--Publisher.},

Seven concepts that can be used to productively compare different media to one another as well as to face to face communication are   
Interactivity - Fornas et al(2002, 23) - social interactivity - the ability of a medium to enable social interaction between groups or individuals* (other kinds are technical - a medium's capability of letting human users manipulate hte machine via its interface, and textual - the creative and interpretive interaction between users and textts)...
Temporal Structure - synchronous vs asynchronous - cost of synchrocity is that we need be fully engaged, and that it can't support as large a group as asynchronous
Social Cues- increased meaning from rich media (e.g. the cost of anonymity)
Storage
Replicability
Reach - the size of an audience they can attain or support... a spot for study in itself
Mobility
 
p 13
the important of remaining focused on specific capabilities and consequences rather than the media themselves
 
p 21
Who is excluded from or enabled by digitally mediated interaction is neither random nor inconsequential.  The same tools may take on very different meanings for different populations in different contexts or different times.
p 24
 there is a strong tendency, especially when technologies are new, to view them as causal agents, entering societies as active forces of change that humans have little power to resist.  This perspective is known as technological determinism.  When media are new, most popular messages about them are deterministic.  A second perspective, the social construction of technology, argues that people are the primary sources of change in both technology and society.  The social shaping perspective sees influence as flowing in both directions.  Ultimately, over time, people stop questioning individual technologies.  Through a process of domestication, they become taken for granted parts of everyday life
 
 
P 27
In a milder form of technological determinism, media choice, technological features are seen as having direct consequences, but people are seen as making strategic, and usually rational, choices about this perspective. 
Tech determinism - we are "used by" the technology - what it does is what it does, we can't control ourselves
p 39
social construction - dangerous because humans, not mahcines, are the agents of change.  One focus is how social forces influence the invention of new technologies
Thus, social feels there is little that the makeup of the technology can tell us
        p41
Fulk found that the perspectives of peers, especially "attractive" peers - those who are friends as well as good colleagues - were strong influences on individuals' attitudes towards emaill.  In a study of attitudes towards mobile phones in the Midwestern US, campbell and russo (2003) also showed that attitudes...shaped by peers
p 44 
The truth probably lies somewhere in between technological determinism and social constructivism...
From this perspective, the consequences of technologies arise from a mix of "affordances" - the social capabilities technological qualities enable - and the unexpected and emergent ways that people make use of those affordances.
Douglas (2004)- Machines do not make history by themselves.  But some kinds of machines help make different kinds of histories and different kinds of people than others."
***p45
***People, technologies and institutions all have power to influence the development and subsequent use of technology.  The are `interrelated nodes in constantly changing sociotechnical networks, which constitute the forms and uses of technology differently in different times and places for different groups)
Domestication - process by which technologies move from being fringe objects to everyday objects - people invest them with their own meanings and significance.... plays out at oboth societal levels and in daily interactions as people figure out where to place devices and, more importantly, who gets to use them for what and who doesnt (p 45) 
p 75
I will identify five qualities found in both online groups and many definitions of community that make the term resoante for online contexts.  These include 
sense of space
shared practice
shared resources
support
shared identites
interpersonal relationship
p 83
when people provide and receive social support in online groups, they are contributing to one another's social capital
 
 
 
 ``According to the Social Identity Theory of Deindividuation Effects, or SIDE Model, the extent to which people identify and behave in accordance with social rather than persoanl identites is influenced by the mediums affprdances, such as anonmymity, which interact with social context ,and social undersandings of the self (e.g. Spears and Lea, 1992).  When people have access to individualizing cues, they are more likely to differenitate themselves from one another.  In anonymous contexts, however, people are more likely to stereotype and conform to group norms, experienceing more of a sense of ``wee'' and less a sense of ``me''.  Thus, Jayhawk fans, when their fandom is at the foreground, take on a jayhawk stance above their own individualized identities  Though one could envision it as...}

We demonstrate that people learned about the protests primarily through interpersonal communication using Facebook, phone contact, or face-to-face conversation. Controlling for other factors, social media use greatly increased the odds that a respondent attended protests on the first day. Half of those surveyed produced and disseminated visuals from the demonstrations, mainly through Facebook.},

	abstract = {The goal of this article is to build a conceptual framework for understanding the role of social media in the so-called ‘Arab Spring’, considering two different disciplinary perspectives: International Relations and Internet Studies. More specifically, it relies on literature on Middle Eastern political systems and on social network sites. It also refers to literature that examines the relationship between (social) media engagement and civic engagement. Building on this foundation, the article analyses the main attempts to evaluate the ‘impact’ of social media on the ‘Arab Spring’ from specific perspectives. Commentators have tended to adopt a dichotomous vision of the topic, either emphasizing the ‘revolutionary’ role of social media or totally minimizing its role; this article defines them as digital evangelists and techno-realists respectively. In order to prove their point of view, both sides focus on the same issues. The study critically analyses the main issues, discussing how they have been interpreted by both digital evangelists and techno-realists. Through a multidisciplinary framework, it proposes a more nuanced picture of the relationship between the social media and the ‘Arab Spring’.},

	abstract = {There is little doubt about whether social networks play a role in modern protests. This agreement has triggered an entire research avenue, in which social structure and content analysis have been central --but are typically exploited separately. Here, we combine these two approaches to shed light on the opinion evolution dynamics in Egypt during the summer of 2013 along two axes (Islamist/Secularist, pro/anti-military intervention). We intend to find traces of opinion changes in Egypt's population, paralleling those in the international community --which oscillated from sympathetic to condemnatory as civil clashes grew. We find little evidence of people "switching" sides, along with clear changes in volume in both pro- and anti-military camps. Our work contributes new insights into the dynamics of large protest movements, specially in the aftermath of the main events --rather unattended previously. It questions the standard narrative concerning a simplistic mapping between Secularist/pro-military and Islamist/anti-military. Finally, our conclusions provide empirical validation to sociological models regarding the behavior of individuals in conflictive contexts.},

The second principle states that a significant increase in the use of the new media is much more likely to follow a significant amount of protest activity than to precede it.

How the army played the dual role of instigating change while impeding it at crucial points in the transitional process is described. The mutual lack of autonomy between the state, the party and the military appears to have been a key factor in impeding change, whereas a clear separation of the functions of these institutions was more likely to enable political change to come about.},

The resulting computational solution can help organizations involved with social causes to disseminate messages in a more informed and effective fashion; potentially leading to greater impact. Our findings suggest that enthusiastic and supportive tweets are more prevalent in tweets about social causes than other types of tweets on Twitter.},

	abstract = {Agent-based simulation models are an important methodology for explaining social behavior and forecasting social change. However, a major drawback to using such models is that they are difficult to instantiate for specific cases and so are rarely reused. We describe a text-mining network analytic approach for rapidly instantiating a model for predicting the tendency toward revolution and violence based on social and cultural characteristics of a large collection of actors. We illustrate our approach using an agent-based dynamic network framework, Construct, and newspaper data for the 16 countries associated with the Arab Spring. We assess the overall accuracy of the base model across independent runs for 20 different months during the Arab Spring, observing that although predictions led to several false positives, the model is able to predict revolution before it occurs in three of the four nations in which the government was successfully overthrown.},

Using computational discourse analysis, we examine news values and the form of news exhibited in \#egypt from January 25 to February 25, 2011, pre- and post-resignation of Hosni Mubarak. Results point to a hybridity of old and newer news values, with emphasis on the drama of instantaneity, the crowdsourcing of elites, solidarity, and ambience. The resulting stream of news combines news, opinion, and emotion to the point where discerning one from the other is difficult and doing so misses the point. We offer a theory of affective news to explain the distinctive character of content produced by networked publics in times of political crisis.},
