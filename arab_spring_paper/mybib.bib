The resulting computational solution can help organizations involved with social causes to disseminate messages in a more informed and effective fashion; potentially leading to greater impact. Our findings suggest that enthusiastic and supportive tweets are more prevalent in tweets about social causes than other types of tweets on Twitter.},

	abstract = {Agent-based simulation models are an important methodology for explaining social behavior and forecasting social change. However, a major drawback to using such models is that they are difficult to instantiate for specific cases and so are rarely reused. We describe a text-mining network analytic approach for rapidly instantiating a model for predicting the tendency toward revolution and violence based on social and cultural characteristics of a large collection of actors. We illustrate our approach using an agent-based dynamic network framework, Construct, and newspaper data for the 16 countries associated with the Arab Spring. We assess the overall accuracy of the base model across independent runs for 20 different months during the Arab Spring, observing that although predictions led to several false positives, the model is able to predict revolution before it occurs in three of the four nations in which the government was successfully overthrown.},

	abstract = {This study traces the rhythms of news storytelling on Twitter via the \#egypt hashtag. Using computational discourse analysis, we examine news values and the form of news exhibited in \#egypt from January 25 to February 25, 2011, pre- and post-resignation of Hosni Mubarak. Results point to a hybridity of old and newer news values, with emphasis on the drama of instantaneity, the crowdsourcing of elites, solidarity, and ambience. The resulting stream of news combines news, opinion, and emotion to the point where discerning one from the other is difficult and doing so misses the point. We offer a theory of affective news to explain the distinctive character of content produced by networked publics in times of political crisis.},
