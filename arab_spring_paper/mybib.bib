We demonstrate that people learned about the protests primarily through interpersonal communication using Facebook, phone contact, or face-to-face conversation. Controlling for other factors, social media use greatly increased the odds that a respondent attended protests on the first day.

	annote = {nearly everyauthoritarian regime in the region scrambled to concoct the “right” mix of repressionand cooptation in the hope of stemming the protest.
 
also thinks its the regime's ability for control (again, Hatem) - "the coercive apparatus, especially the coercive apparatus’ varying will torepress, has indeed proved paramount to determining the durability of authoritarian regimes in the region. In every Arab country where serious protest erupted, regimesurvival ultimately turned on one question: would the military defect? Or, more specifically,would the military shoot the protesters or not?"
 
Clearly, a good number of authoritarian regimeshave survived the Arab Spring in large part because they have not faced massive popularuprisings. Although spurts of protest erupted in nearly every part of the region,many countries escaped massive protest at this time, including Saudi Arabia, Morocco,Algeria, and Jordan. The failure of protest to snowball in these countries is attributableto a variety of factors, including the effective cooptation of the citizenry via the regime’sgenerous distribution of “buy-outs” (Saudi Arabia), societal exhaustion from prolongedcivil war and the subsequent desire for calm (Algeria), and the successful division andcooptation of opposition elites topped off by the protective logic of monarchy (Moroccoand Jordan). Insight into these strategies is provided by the “persistence of authoritarianism”literature cited above.
 
The logical question that follows is this: when does a coercive apparatus defect?
 
the question of the character and motivations of the coerciveapparatus is complex. But when it comes to mass unrest such as that seen on {HabibBourguiba} Avenue or Tahrir Square, where tens of thousands of angry people assembledto demand an end to the regime in power, such mobilization usually overwhelmsthe capacity of the regular police and/or intelligence services. In that case, regimesurvival turns on the military (primarily the army) and its willingness and capacity tobring in the tanks, the heavy weapons, and the men in numbers large enough to containa mass uprising. And so, despite the complex character of the coercive apparatus, incases of mass protest such as seen during the Arab Spring, it is sufficient to look atthe character of the military and its capacity and will to repress in order to reckon theimmediate chances of regime survival.
 
military capacity, or the lack of it, was not really the pivotalissue determining regime survival.24 The variation observed in the repression of protestersdid not generally turn on the question of sufficient supply of tanks, machineguns, or men. Rather,successful military repression of the uprising turned on the question of will.
******Using lethal force against civilians threatens to undermine the image ofthe military as defender of the nation, especially if the crowds are representative of the“nation” and cannot be dismissed as distinctly “other” along class, sectarian, or ethnic lines ***
If the number of civilianchallengers is small, using lethal force against them is not so problematic. But if the levelof social mobilization is high, then the costs of repression will be high as well, since usinglethal force against large numbers of civilians will come across as illegitimate slaughter
the degreeto which the military elite is personally invested in the regime’s survival.
When the military is deeply invested in the survival of the regimebecause of its blood ties, or its ethnic/sectarian ties, or its crony capitalist ties to theregime, that military has significant incentive to shoot civilians even if such actionviolates its other mandates
Lookingat the first countries where popular protest caught fire, Tunisia and Egypt, we findfour factors were essential to setting the protest in motion: long-standing grievances, anemotional trigger, a sense of impunity, and access to new social media.
Emotional trigger: ordinary people take to the streets when theyfeel compelled by some strong emotion such as anger, fear, or euphoria. ... popular outrage in Tunisia was further stoked by a second factor as well—the decision by the regime to resort to lethal force to put down the demonstrations....Although the military ultimately refused to fire on protesters, other branches of thecoercive apparatus were not so chary. In fact, from the beginning the police resortedto lethal measures in an attempt to contain the proteste
Impunity: rational calculation of risk led people to join the demonstrations in largenumbers once one crucial fact became clear—that the military would not shoot. ... A carnival-like atmosphere prevailedin Tahrir Square. People brought their children to witness the historic moment.
 
Social media (Facebook, Twitter, {YouTube}, cell phones with video feed capacity)and satellite television (al-Jazeera, al-Arabiya) together enabled the mobilization of collectiveaction in ways that had been heretofore impossible in repressive settings...social media provided the means for coordinatingand synchronizing thousands of people, making mass gatherings possible even in theabsence of formal organizational infrastructure (something the regime would haveworked hard to decimate). And when social media failed (for example, when {theEgyptian} regime temporarily shut down the internet), satellite television filled in thegap—with programming on al-Jazeera providing real-time coverage of events andalerting people to the location and tactics of the next protest....The past failureof social media to deliver crowds of protesters to the Kefaya movement in Egyptshows that the social media’s contribution is permissive, not deterministic ... In addition,authoritarian regimes can use this same social media to detect, monitor, divide,and rule opposition forces, illustrating its capacity to abet authoritarianism’s resilienceas much as undermine it.
 
none of the four factors identified as important inmobilizing protest in Egypt and Tunisia is either necessary or sufficient to explain theincidence of mass protests witnessed elsewhere during the Arab Spring. ... the cause, then, is diffusion.  David Patel, Valerie Bunce, and Sharon Wochick identify two differentlogics: (1) the logic of deliberate diffusion, carried out via the conscious sharing oftactics and frames by activists who are linked by networks that may be transnational;and (2) the logic of demonstration effect (that is, “the power of precedent”).
that many political phenomena, including protest, democratization,and revolution, violate one of the fundamental assumptions of social science theorizing(including statistical analysis), namely, “the independence of cases. This seriously challenges any ambition to build predictive hypotheses rooted solely inthe analysis of the causal processes governing first cases. Timing matters.
confirms the importance of shared culture, history, and identity to explaining key politicalphenomena such as protest and social mobilization...it is cultural and historical proximity, not geographic vicinity, which is keyto emulation},

"Personalist regime" stuff
The neopatrimonial state is based on the systematic expansion of the power of an authoritarianleader; usually, the ‘sultan’ is able to control the fate of a country for a prolonged period of time, atthe expense of formal institutions. Eisenstadt (1973, 1999) was one of the first and mostprominent scholars to analyse this kind of government. He described the way that some statesdeveloped a form of neopatrimonial power in which an authoritarian leader takes control ofthe administrative apparatus and achieves significant economic power through which theloyalty of the elite is earned by guaranteeing privileges and rewards.
In the neopatrimonial state, the masses aredepoliticized and unorganized (Montessoro 2005; Goldstone 2011) and have little ability tocontrol the regularity of electoral procedures and policies.
In this environment, it is not easy to organize an uprising; in order to mobilize people andoccupy squares and streets, the protestors have to challenge regimes that are particularlyskilful in suppressing internal dissent
***These factors allow the rebels to involve broad sections of the population in the mobilizationphase, overcoming existing divisions (especially ethnic and religious discord).***
Two otherelements are essential to producing regime change in neopatrimonial states: first, the contextinvolves unwilling leaders of the armed forces, too tired to defend the regime and the‘sultan’; second, it is important that international, regional and global powers do not act tosupport the ‘sultan’ and prohibit the use of intolerable levels of violence against the civilianpopulation during the revolt (Kaldor and Kostovicova 2008).
Structuralist studies on revolutions have demonstrated that mobilization inurban areas was not the expression of disorganized and ignorant masses of people; rather,urban uprisings are controlled by educated individuals, often long-time residents of the city,well rooted in the metropolitan social environment (Gugler 1982).
The direct causes that moreoften trigger the urban uprisings are of two types – related either to food shortages (shortageof food itself, distribution problems or high food prices) or unemployment – or to acombination of these two factors. The first phase of the social uprisings in Egypt and Tunisiacan be directly linked to precisely these two factors (Goldstone 2011).
 
Following Jenkins, contemporary society is characterized by what can be defined as convergenceculture: a culture ‘where old and new media collide, where grassroots and corporate mediaintersect, where the power of the media producer and the power of the media consumerinteract in unpredictable ways’ (Jenkins 2006, 259–60). In such a context, separating whatusers do with one medium from what they do with other media would be misleading: evenso-called ‘old’ and ‘new’ media create a continuum, and users are constantly shifting from oneplatform to another.

	abstract = {There is little doubt about whether social networks play a role in modern protests. This agreement has triggered an entire research avenue, in which social structure and content analysis have been central --but are typically exploited separately. Here, we combine these two approaches to shed light on the opinion evolution dynamics in Egypt during the summer of 2013 along two axes (Islamist/Secularist, pro/anti-military intervention). We intend to find traces of opinion changes in Egypt's population, paralleling those in the international community --which oscillated from sympathetic to condemnatory as civil clashes grew. We find little evidence of people "switching" sides, along with clear changes in volume in both pro- and anti-military camps. Our work contributes new insights into the dynamics of large protest movements, specially in the aftermath of the main events --rather unattended previously. It questions the standard narrative concerning a simplistic mapping between Secularist/pro-military and Islamist/anti-military. Finally, our conclusions provide empirical validation to sociological models regarding the behavior of individuals in conflictive contexts.},

Many have hypothesized that increased Internet usage supports the growth of democratic institutions (Hogan 1999; Abbott 2001; George 2006).Yet both democracies and dictatorships have fast-growing numbers of Internetusers, Internet hosts, mobile phones, and personal computers. Authoritarianregimes may develop their digital communication infrastructure specifically toextend state power (Kalathil and Boas 2003).digital technologies (may) provide the entry points for young activists to explore democratic alternatives, an action landscape such as cyberspace that allows for political discourse and even direct interventions with state policy, and coordinating mechanisms that support synchronized social movements through marches, protests, and other forms of collective action (Kirsh 2001; Warschauer, El Said, and Zohry 2002; Abdulla 2005, 2007; Shapiro 2009).it makes most sense to look for “conjoined causal conditions,” the set of multiple indicators that together provide a fulfilling narrative for understanding political outcomes. An examination of the political impacts of digital technologies should not assume positive or negative {effectsIndependent} Variables used:    Average Incomes Within Country    Wealth Distribution (Gini)    Levels of Unemployment    Demographic Variables (pop. size, degree of urbanization, youth buldge)    Censorship Sophistication (we created an index combining the {OpenNet} Initiative’s monitoring of countries that had instituted no filtering, or a range of selective, substantial, and pervasive filtering on content for political, social, security reasons or used automated tools to do s)    Fuel-dependent Economy (countries’ level of oil production and its share in the global oil resources available)Dependent variables    Regime Fragility - Full membership in the set of fragile Arab Spring countries was given to the countries where street turnout was surprisingly large, attendance was consistently high over several days, domestic media attention unusually interested, and protests took place in an unexpected number of diverse locations. Lower scores went to cases where protest turnout was small, concentrated in only a few locations, or protesters themselves were quickly dissuaded.    Social Movement Success Results:First, not being a country where the national economy is dependent on fuel exports is a consistent ingredient in all the recipes of social movement success. Second, widespread use of mobile phone technologies was less important for the success of social movements than Internet use. However, the latter does appear as a key ingredient in two causal recipes. Therefore, having a mobile-enabled population is useful, particularly when protests have been ignited. But more than access to mobile technologies, having a long-term Internet-enabled civil society appears in all recipes.{DiscussionFor} scholars of social movements and collective action, there are severalinteresting aspects of the Arab Spring: the distributed leadership of protestorganizers, the core groups of elite publics (literate, middle class, youth, women,and technocrats) that were relatively quick in joining them, and the importantrole that international news organizations played in giving them the global exposureto help stave off overtly violent reactions from security forces.Digital media had a causal role in {theArab} Spring by providing the very infrastructure that created deep communicationties and organizational capacity in groups of activists before the major proteststook {placFor} the most part, it was physicalintimidation that discouraged activists from communicating about their politicalactivity on {FacebookA} peripheralcounting of media use and digital diffusion levels reveals that the countriesexperiencing the most dramatic changes had low overall percentages of socialmedia use (Mourtada and Salem 2011). But limiting the analysis to aggregateindicators precludes the possibility of telling a more complex, causal story. Moreover,if there is anything to the analytical frame of networks, the use of importantmedia by a few important nodes of users could be exceptionallyconsequential. This is why, to unpack the complexities of the Arab Spring, wemust employ analytic approaches that make possible the examination of complexsocial systems that constitute the overall aggregate of state-based cases.},

However, a major drawback to using such models is that they are difficult to instantiate for specific cases and so are rarely reused. We describe a text-mining network analytic approach for rapidly instantiating a model for predicting the tendency toward revolution and violence based on social and cultural characteristics of a large collection of actors. We illustrate our approach using an agent-based dynamic network framework, Construct, and newspaper data for the 16 countries associated with the Arab Spring. We assess the overall accuracy of the base model across independent runs for 20 different months during the Arab Spring, observing that although predictions led to several false positives, the model is able to predict revolution before it occurs in three of the four nations in which the government was successfully overthrown.},

Using computational discourse analysis, we examine news values and the form of news exhibited in \#egypt from January 25 to February 25, 2011, pre- and post-resignation of Hosni Mubarak. Results point to a hybridity of old and newer news values, with emphasis on the drama of instantaneity, the crowdsourcing of elites, solidarity, and ambience. The resulting stream of news combines news, opinion, and emotion to the point where discerning one from the other is difficult and doing so misses the point. We offer a theory of affective news to explain the distinctive character of content produced by networked publics in times of political crisis.},
