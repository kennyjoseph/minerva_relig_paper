Why newspaper is bad data for this: 
    Difficult to extract organizers, who is actually involved if you arent native and involved in the scene

Questions he asked to get at instability
		when was the first time you saw a cop?
		were you working w/ the military



People responded to instability by creating their own states, (re)defining thugs and prosecuting them
    thugs are people w/ darker skin from specific neighborhoods ... state used thug for people who 

the state runs through the threat of instability -> 	
    
		the downtown area before aug 2013 ... every week protests ...  we need people to pick up *trash*

		Luxor -> Islamist attack in the 90s

		Political islamists are the other  (since the 20s)

		state insecurity -> terrorist attacks (Anti islamist/extrimists)	

a lot of Egyptian scholars have dismissed Islamist symbolism  ... the people want a secular gov't
