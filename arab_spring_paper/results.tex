1. lag data
2. category
3. revolutionary state

\emph{for h1}

twitter network structure
	eng/ar split, by week, before/during/after
 	components, modularity of LWCC, n news, n mixed

news:
	term counts
	term centralities

controls: 
	size metrics - number of actors, number of posts, number of words, number of ties

EXPLANATION -> sheer topic counts - hashtags, 

metrics:
	revolutionary success (long run)
	mention of revolution
	vingettes - goldstone in short-term


\emph{step 2}

Lets see correlations, add some spurious stuff in there and some other potential stuff in there, see what agrees with what
	
\emph{other}
international network position
religious freedom indices
